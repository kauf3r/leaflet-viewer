# Security Audit Report - GeoTIFF Showcase Tool

## Executive Summary

This security audit analyzes the Leaflet Viewer project, a Next.js application designed to showcase GeoTIFF photogrammetry outputs. The audit covers both the current minimal codebase and anticipated security risks based on the comprehensive PRD requirements for GeoTIFF file handling, client-side processing, and cloud storage integration.

**Overall Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Current implementation: LOW risk (minimal attack surface)
- Planned implementation: MEDIUM-HIGH risk (file uploads, URL processing, WebAssembly)

**Key Findings**:
- No immediate critical vulnerabilities in current codebase
- Significant security considerations for planned GeoTIFF processing features
- Missing security headers and Content Security Policy
- Potential for high-impact vulnerabilities with file upload and URL input features

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Missing Content Security Policy (Future Implementation)
- **Location**: `/Users/andykaufman/leaflet-viewer/src/app/layout.tsx` and `/Users/andykaufman/leaflet-viewer/next.config.ts`
- **Description**: No Content Security Policy headers are configured, which will be critical when implementing GeoTIFF processing with WebAssembly and external URL loading
- **Impact**: XSS attacks, malicious script injection, unauthorized resource loading
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Add CSP headers in Next.js configuration for WebAssembly support
  - [ ] Implement strict CSP policy allowing only necessary domains
  - [ ] Configure CSP for WebAssembly with `'unsafe-eval'` only where absolutely necessary
  - [ ] Add CSP nonce support for inline scripts
  - [ ] Test CSP with GDAL WebAssembly modules

### 2. File Upload Security Risks (Planned Feature)
- **Location**: Not yet implemented - will be in upload components
- **Description**: The PRD specifies direct file upload for GeoTIFF files up to 1GB, creating multiple security vectors
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, server-side attacks, denial of service, malicious file processing
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement strict file type validation (magic number checking, not just extension)
  - [ ] Set maximum file size limits (current PRD allows 1GB - consider reducing)
  - [ ] Scan uploaded files for malicious content before processing
  - [ ] Process files in sandboxed environment
  - [ ] Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
  - [ ] Use Content-Disposition headers to prevent direct execution

## Conclusion

The GeoTIFF Showcase Tool presents significant security challenges due to its file processing, URL handling, and WebAssembly requirements. While the current minimal codebase has low security risk, the planned features introduce multiple high-risk attack vectors that require careful security architecture and implementation.

Priority should be given to implementing comprehensive file upload security, SSRF prevention, and WebAssembly sandboxing before deploying the full feature set. The security measures outlined in this report provide a roadmap for building a secure, production-ready GeoTIFF visualization tool.

Regular security reviews and updates will be essential as the application evolves and new threats emerge in the geospatial data processing domain.
