### **Section 3 of 6: User Interface Enhancement Goals**

#### **3.1. Integration with Existing UI**

* As this is the first UI component for the application, it will establish the foundational design. The layout should be clean, professional, and suitable for a technical/business audience.

#### **3.2. Modified/New Screens and Views**

* **File Conversion/Upload View**: A user interface for users to select a large local GeoTIFF file, run the conversion process, and initiate the upload. This view must provide clear feedback on the conversion status.
* **Case Study Map View**: An interactive map viewer that displays the processed GeoTIFF data. This will be the primary interface for showcasing case studies.

#### **3.3. UI Consistency Requirements**

* The interface should be intuitive, requiring minimal instruction for a user to upload and view a map.
* Error messages must be clear and helpful (e.g., "Coordinate system mismatch. Expected EPSG:4326 but file is EPSG:3857.").

---
### **Section 4 of 6: Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements**

#### **4.1. Existing Technology Stack**

* **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js)
* **Frameworks**: None (The existing tool is built with standard Node.js libraries)
* **Database**: None
* **Infrastructure**: Local execution environment
* **External Dependencies**: Command-line interface and file system libraries (e.g., `commander`, `fs-extra`, `glob`).

#### **4.2. Integration Approach**

* **Database Integration Strategy**: This feature will require a data store to track uploaded files and their tile sets. A cloud-based object storage like **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** is recommended for the tiles, with a simple database (like **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**) to store metadata.
* **API Integration Strategy**: A new REST API will be created to handle file uploads, processing status checks, and serving map tile data to the front end.
* **Frontend Integration Strategy**: A new single-page application (SPA) will be developed. It will be a distinct component within the project, interacting with the backend via the new REST API.
* **Testing Integration Strategy**: A new testing suite (e.g., using Jest or Vitest) will be established for the web service, separate from any tests for the existing CLI tool.

#### **4.3. Code Organization and Standards**

* **File Structure Approach**: I recommend restructuring the project into a **monorepo** to house both the existing CLI tool and the new web service.
    ```
    /
    ├── packages/
    │   ├── cli/      # Existing CLI tool
    │   └── web/      # New web service (backend + frontend)
    └── package.json
    ```
* **Naming Conventions**: We will establish and follow standard conventions for the chosen web framework (e.g., Next.js, NestJS).
* **Coding Standards**: We will use a standard linter and formatter like ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistency.

#### **4.4. Deployment and Operations**

* **Build Process Integration**: The `package.json` will be updated with new scripts to build, test, and run the web service.
* **Deployment Strategy**: A container-based approach using **Docker** is recommended for deployment to a cloud service like **AWS ECS** or **Google Cloud Run**. This will handle the heavy processing of large GeoTIFF files effectively.
* **Monitoring and Logging**: Basic logging will be implemented in the new web service to track file processing and errors.

#### **4.5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

* **Technical Risks**:
    * Processing massive (50GB+) GeoTIFF files is memory and CPU intensive. **Mitigation**: Use a streaming-based processing library (like GDAL via a native Node.js binding) in a container with sufficient resources.
    * Ensuring the client-side conversion tool is user-friendly and reliable. **Mitigation**: Choose a well-supported library that can compile to WebAssembly for in-browser use or create a simple desktop app.
* **Integration Risks**: Low, as the new web service will be largely separate from the existing CLI tool.
* **Deployment Risks**: High, as this introduces a completely new deployment pipeline. **Mitigation**: Start with a simple, manually-triggered deployment process and build out automation (CI/CD) over time.

### **Section 5 of 6: Epic and Story Structure**

#### **5.1. Epic Approach**

* **Epic Structure Decision**: This enhancement will be structured as a **single, comprehensive epic**.
* **Rationale**: The goal is to deliver one cohesive feature: the GeoTIFF viewing pipeline. A single epic ensures all related work—from the pre-upload converter to the final map display—is tracked as a single, value-driven unit. This aligns with your goal of creating proper scaffolding for this new capability.

---
### **Section 6 of 6: Epic 1: GeoTIFF Processing and Visualization Pipeline**

* **Epic Goal**: To establish an end-to-end pipeline for converting, uploading, processing, and displaying large GeoTIFF files on an interactive web map, providing the foundational scaffolding for all future geospatial features.
* **Integration Requirements**: The new web service must be contained within the proposed `packages/web` monorepo structure and not interfere with the existing `packages/cli` tool.

---
* **Story 1.1: Web Service Scaffolding**
    * As a developer, I want a basic web service and frontend application scaffold within the monorepo, so that there is a foundational structure for building the GeoTIFF viewer feature.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  A `packages/web` directory is created in the project root.
        2.  The `web` package contains a basic Node.js/Express backend server that can start and respond to a health-check request (e.g., GET /api/health).
        3.  The `web` package contains a basic frontend application scaffold (e.g., using Vite + React).
        4.  Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend services are created.
        5.  A `docker-compose.yml` file is added to the root to run the new web services locally.

---
* **Story 1.2: File Upload Endpoint & Cloud Storage**
    * As a user, I want a secure API endpoint to upload my optimized GeoTIFF file, so that it can be stored reliably for processing.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  A `POST /api/upload` endpoint is created.
        2.  The endpoint accepts multipart/form-data file uploads.
        3.  The uploaded file is successfully saved to a configured cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3).
        4.  The API returns a unique identifier for the uploaded file upon success.
        5.  The API returns a `400 Bad Request` error if no file is provided.

---
* **Story 1.3: GeoTIFF Tiling Service with CRS Validation**
    * As a system, I want to process an uploaded GeoTIFF file by validating its Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and converting it into a web-standard map tile format, so that it can be displayed efficiently on a map.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  A new service is created that can be triggered by a file upload.
        2.  The service reads the CRS from the GeoTIFF's metadata.
        3.  If the CRS does not match the required system (e.g., EPSG:4326), the process fails with a clear error.
        4.  If the CRS is valid, the service uses a library like GDAL to generate map tiles at multiple zoom levels.
        5.  The generated tiles are stored in cloud storage in a structured directory (e.g., `/{file_id}/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`).

---
* **Story 1.4: Basic Interactive Map Viewer UI**
    * As a user, I want a basic web page with an interactive map component, so that I have a place to view my processed geospatial data.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  A new page is created in the frontend application at the `/map` route.
        2.  The page displays a full-screen map using a library like Leaflet or MapLibre GL.
        3.  The map initializes with a default base layer (e.g., OpenStreetMap).
        4.  Users can pan and zoom the map using standard controls.

---
* **Story 1.5: Tile Server API & UI Integration**
    * As a developer, I want an API endpoint to serve the processed map tiles and connect the UI to it, so that users can see their specific GeoTIFF data on the map.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  A `GET /api/tiles/{file_id}/{z}/{x}/{y}` endpoint is created that serves the corresponding map tile from cloud storage.
        2.  The frontend map viewer is updated to accept a `file_id`.
        3.  The map viewer constructs tile URLs using the `file_id` and adds the GeoTIFF tile layer to the map.
        4.  The GeoTIFF data correctly overlays the base map.

---
* **Story 1.6: Client-Side Pre-processing Tool**
    * As a user with very large GeoTIFF files (up to 50 GB), I want a client-side tool to pre-process and reduce the file to a manageable size, so that I can upload it efficiently.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The UI includes a file input for selecting a large local GeoTIFF file.
        2.  When a file is selected, a client-side process (e.g., using WebAssembly) begins to resize or re-sample the image.
        3.  The UI displays clear progress feedback during the conversion process.
        4.  Upon completion, the tool provides the optimized file for the user to upload via the `POST /api/upload` endpoint.
